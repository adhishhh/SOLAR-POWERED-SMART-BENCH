# SOLAR-POWERED-SMART-BENCH
the solar-powered smart bench is a great addition to any educational institution looking to provide students with easy access to learning materials and the internet while promoting sustainable energy practices

This project is a solar-powered smart bench designed for use in educational institutions. The bench is equipped with an RFID reader that allows students to log in and access learning materials or connect to the internet. The bench also has a built-in solar panel, which provides power for the bench and the RFID reader.

The bench is designed to be durable and weather-resistant, making it suitable for outdoor use. It is made from high-quality materials that are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions.

The RFID system is easy to use, and students can simply scan their ID cards to log in and access the system. The system can also be used to track student attendance and monitor student activity on the bench.

The solar panel is connected to a battery system that stores energy during the day and powers the bench and the RFID reader at night. This means that the bench can be used even in areas where there is no access to electricity.
